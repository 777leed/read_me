            His coffee was already cold when he got up, 4:33 she left the bed again without a word, I can't remember the last time I saw her face, I haven't seen her lips move in so long, what is she thinking leaving me voicemails every morning like I'm living with some ghost. Your wife is dead; she always has been. What are you still waiting for? It's a cold night, and you are staying up late again. Do you want to get sick again? Don't you remember what your doctor said? She opened the drawer, made him swallow his pills, now he is asleep.<br><br>
            He looks so peaceful when he is asleep. Isn't it wonderful this temporal death we have been blessed with? All the dead people are asleep, and all the asleep ones are dead, both lifeless and can do no harm. No prison is tighter than one's mind, and nothing is more precious than someone's life. Who could've believed that this sleeping angel took her life so vainly? He was never stable; we always knew he could do something regretful. Regret found no way to slip through his wrecked mind, neither does his wife; she's still there trapped within topless walls and bottomless pits...
